For this homework, I decided to refactor the Ultimate Audio Visualizer. I chose TypeScript.

For the TypeScript portion of this assignment, I basically followed the refactor a project
into TypeScript guide that was linked in the instructions, so I typed every variable and
function parameter, used enums and interfaces, etc. The only thing that I did not do is
do function destructuring. 

For the Bulma, I did very basic things. Just some simple fonts, colors, and margins. I tried
to get the Bulma dropdown menu working, but ran into too many problems, so kept it as a generic
HTML Select. Other than that, everything else should be Bulmaified.
